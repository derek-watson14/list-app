This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# List App


### Short development history

This web application is based on the 'Booklist' section of **Net Ninja's "React Context and Hooks"** YouTube tutorial. I was watching to tutorial to get a basic grasp on (who'd have guessed) React context and hooks for another tutorial I was also working on.

I decided that to really cement what I had learned, I would have to add a few things to the raw end-of-tutorial project. First I just added a button that allowed the user to mark a book as currently being read. I then decided to add an icon for deletion, so it was harder to accidently do so. Next I wanted the user to have the ability to rearrage the list via drag and drop, so I found the wonerful **React Beautiful Drag and Drop** library by Atlassian ([found here](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)). Next I made the 'add a book' menu retractable and changed a few other styles.

I now quite like how it is shaping up and want to continue adding more features to make it my own.


### Future Feature Ideas:
*Ideas listed from soonest to furthest away*

#### Confirm delete button:
Should appear upon click on the trash can icon.

#### Rearrange Handle:
A six-dot handle on the left end of the list items that allows the user to rearrange items.

#### Edit color scheme:
Make either presets or choose-your-own color scheme options.

#### Multiple lists:
The user can create multiple lists and select one to look at at a given moment.

#### Database integration:
Save information in a database and not on local storage in the browser.

#### Multiple Users:
This is further off, but goes hand in hard with database integration. Create log in and out for multiple users.
