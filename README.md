This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# List App

### Short development history

This web application is based on the 'Booklist'section of Net Ninja's "React Context and Hooks" YouTube tutorial. I was watching to tutorial to get a basic grasp on (who'd have guessed) React context and hooks for another tutorial I was also working on.

I decided that to really cement what I had learned, I would have to add a few things to the raw end-of-tutorial project. I first just added a button that allowed the user to mark a book as currently being read. I then decided to add an icon for deletion, so it was harder to accidently do so. Next I wanted the user to have the ability to rearrage the list via drag and drop, so I found the wonerful React Beautiful Drag and Drop library by Atlassian ([found here](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)). Next I made the 'add a book' menu retractable and changed a few other styles.

I now quite like how it is shaping up and want to continue adding more features to make it my own.

### Future Feature Ideas:

* #### Confirm delete button:
  --* Should appear upon click on trash can icon

* #### Rearrange Handle:
  --* A six-dot handle on the left end of the list items that allows the user to rearrange

* #### Edit color scheme:
  --* Either preset or choose your own color scheme options

* #### Multiple lists:
  --* The user can create multiple lists and select one to look at at a given moment

* #### Database integration:
  --* Save information in a database and not on local storage
